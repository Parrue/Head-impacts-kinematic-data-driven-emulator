## Introduction

A data-driven emulator of head impacts kinematic, based on on-field measured kinematic data from contact sports (American football, mixed martial arts and boxing).

The generated kinematic data will be composed by 3D linear acceleration, angular velocity and angular acceleration with time length of 100 ms and sample frequency of 1000Hz. 

## Before Installation

In order to run the stand-alone program you need to install MATLAB Runtime R2020a (9.8). You can download it from https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html.

## INPUT and OUTPUT of the program

The data-driven emulator requires INPUT parameters from the user. Those parameters are:

- **Number of required data**: 
- issues (waffle.io maybe)
