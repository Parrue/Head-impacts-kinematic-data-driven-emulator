# Head impacts kinematic data-driven emulator

> Introduction

A data-driven emulator of head impacts kinematic, based on on-field measured kinematic data from contact sports (American football, mixed martial arts and boxing).

The generated kinematic data will be composed by 3D linear acceleration, angular velocity and angular acceleration with time length of 100 ms and sample frequency of 1000Hz.
